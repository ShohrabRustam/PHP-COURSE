    1. $color = array('blue ', 'green', 'black', 'white ', 'red');
Write a script which will display the following string -
The memory of that scene for me is like a frame of film forever frozen at that moment: the red carpet, the green lawn, the white house, the leaden sky.
and the words 'red', 'green' and 'white' will come from $color.
2. $color = array('Black', 'green', 'red'')
Write a PHP script which will display the colors in the following way :
Output :
1. Black, Green, Red,
• green
• red
• white
3. $ceu = array( "Italy"=>"Rome", "Luxembourg"=>"Luxembourg", "Belgium"=> "Brussels", "Denmark"=>"Copenhagen", "Finland"=>"Helsinki", "France" => "Paris", "Slovakia"=>"Bratislava", "Slovenia"=>"Ljubljana", "Germany" => "Berlin", "Greece" => "Athens", "Ireland"=>"Dublin", "Netherlands"=>"Amsterdam", "Portugal"=>"Lisbon", "Spain"=>"Madrid", "Sweden"=>"Stockholm", "United Kingdom"=>"London", "Cyprus"=>"Nicosia", "Lithuania"=>"Vilnius", "Czech Republic"=>"Prague", "Estonia"=>"Tallin", "Hungary"=>"Budapest", "Latvia"=>"Riga", "Malta"=>"Valetta", "Austria" => "Vienna", "Poland"=>"Warsaw") ;
Create a PHP script which displays the capital and country name from the above array $ceu. Sort the list by the capital of the country.
Sample Output :
The capital of Netherlands is Amsterdam
The capital of Greece is Athens
The capital of Germany is Berlin

4. $x = array(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);
Delete an element from the above PHP array. After deleting the element, integer keys must be normalized.
Sample Output :
array(5) { [0]=>int(1) [1]=>int(2) [2]=>int(3) [3]=>int(4) [4]=>int(5) }
array(4) { [0]=>int(1) [1]=>int(2) [2]=>int(3) [3]=>int(5) }
5. $color = array(4 => 'white', 6 => 'green', 11=> 'red');
Write a PHP script to get the first element of the above array.
Expected result : white
6. Write a PHP script that inserts a new item in an array in any position.
Expected Output :
Original array :
1 2 3 4 5
After inserting '$' the array is :
1 2 3 $ 4 5
7. Write a PHP script to sort the following associative array :
array("Sophia"=>"31","Jacob"=>"41","William"=>"39","Ramesh"=>"40") in
a) ascending order sort by value
b) ascending order sort by Key
c) descending order sorting by Value
d) descending order sorting by Key
8. Write a PHP script to calculate and display average temperature, five lowest and highest temperatures.
Recorded temperatures : 78, 60, 62, 68, 71, 68, 73, 85, 66, 64, 76, 63, 75, 76, 73, 68, 62, 73, 72, 65, 74, 62, 62, 65, 64, 68, 73, 75, 79, 73
Expected Output :
Average Temperature is : 70.6
List of seven lowest temperatures : 60, 62, 63, 63, 64,
List of seven highest temperatures : 76, 78, 79, 81, 85,
9. Write a PHP program to sort an array of positive integers using the Bead-Sort Algorithm.
According to Wikipedia "Bead-sort is a natural sorting algorithm, developed by Joshua J. Arulanandham, Cristian S. Calude and Michael J. Dinneen in 2002. Both digital and analog hardware implementations of bead sort can achieve a sorting time of O(n); however, the implementation of this algorithm tends to be significantly slower in software and can only be used to sort lists of positive integers".
Input array : Array ( [0] => 5 [1] => 3 [2] => 1 [3] => 3 [4] => 8 [5] => 7 [6] => 4 [7] => 1 [8] => 1 [9] => 3 )
Expected Result : Array ( [0] => 8 [1] => 7 [2] => 5 [3] => 4 [4] => 3 [5] => 3 [6] => 3 [7] => 1 [8] => 1 [9] => 1 )

10. Write a PHP program to merge (by index) the following two arrays.
Sample arrays :
$array1 = array(array(77, 87), array(23, 45));
$array2 = array("w3resource", "com");
Expected Output :
Array
(
[0] => Array
(
[0] => w3resource
[1] => 77
[2] => 87
)
[1] => Array
(
[0] => com
[1] => 23
[2] => 45
)
)
11. Write a PHP function to change the following array's all values to upper or lower case.
Sample arrays :
$Color = array('A' => 'Blue', 'B' => 'Green', 'c' => 'Red');
Expected Output :
Values are in lower case.
Array ( [A] => blue [B] => green [c] => red )
Values are in upper case.
Array ( [A] => BLUE [B] => GREEN [c] => RED )
12. Write a PHP script which displays all the numbers between 200 and 250 that are divisible by 4.
Note : Do not use any PHP control statement.
Expected Output : 200,204,208,212,216,220,224,228,232,236,240,244,248
13. Write a PHP script to get the shortest/longest string length from an array.
Sample arrays : ("abcd","abc","de","hjjj","g","wer")
Expected Output : The shortest array length is 1. The longest array length is 4.
14. Write a PHP script to generate unique random numbers within a range.
Sample Range : (11, 20)
Sample Output : 17 16 13 20 14 19 18 15 11 12
15. Write a PHP script to get the largest key in an array.
<h2>Second Assignment</h2>
<p>
Assignment For Function
1. Write a function to calculate the factorial of a number (a non-negative integer). The function
accepts the number as an argument.
2. Write a function to check whether a number is prime or not.
Note: A prime number (or a prime) is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive
divisors other than 1 and itself.
3. Write a function to reverse a string.
4. Write a function to sort an array.
5. Write a PHP function that checks whether a string is all lowercase.
6Write a PHP fu. nction that checks whether a passed string is a palindrome or not?
A palindrome is a word, phrase, or sequence that reads the same backward as forward, e.g.,
