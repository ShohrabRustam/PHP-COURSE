    </header>
<p>Lake Tahoe is unique in that it is endorheic basin.
     This means that it drains into the Truckee River and instead of flowing toward the ocean as most rivers do, 
     it flows east into the mountains with a final destination in Pyramid Lake. 
     Lake Tahoe contains 39 trillion gallons of water, which is enough water to supply every human being in the United States with 50 gallons of water every day for five years.
